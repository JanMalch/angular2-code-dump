## Template Driven Forms
You start and do most of the work in the Angular template by adding bindings with custom directives; Angular creates the according form control objects behind the scenes


## Reactive Forms
You start in your component class, by creating your form programmatically before then binding the resulting object to the template; you’re in charge/control of every single step; you have observable streams on changes of the form elements etc..
